# freeCodeCamp
My personal projects for freeCodeCamp lessons.

# How to view
The websites are uploaded with src and dist directories. View the index file in the dist directory to see the website as it should appear on codepen.io.

# What I've completed so far
Within the freeCodeCamp course selection, I have completed Responsive Web Design, Javascript Algorithms and Data Structures, and Front End Development Libraries.

I have uploaded my projects from Responsive Web Design which are mostly complete. I started some of the Front End Development projects, but got caught up
with college coursework. I hope to revisit these once I have time to pursue web development in my free time once again.
